gomap
=====

gomap provides an easy way to find functions/files in your project and get the information you need from them.
It currently doesn't support saving the projects, but it opens them quick enough not to matter for right now.

Commands
--------
  * help       - Prints all commands, or a specific command's help.
  * exit/quit  - Stops gomap.
  * function   - If no args, then it prints out all functions in you project.
                  Else it print all the instances of the function.

                  Else it prints all the functions in the file.

                  lots of random stuff :) (4 things)
